WORD FIND GAME WITH AURE OVERVIEW

Hi There, I developed Word find game using AURA and Apex and Data Modeling and SLDS.

here I used  below AURA Components to complete this.
1) Block
2) Board
3) Board Panel

 Block Component:
 This component is used to show the word in a block and a;lso used FitText.js library to fit the text inside the block.

Board Componnet:

This is used to host the block component in Easy , Medium , Hard formatted pattern.(i.e, 3*3 , 4*4, 6*6)
